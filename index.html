      <div>
	The Swiss Remote Sensing Days (SRSD) is a gathering for the
	Swiss remote sensing community, initialized by
	the <a href="https://scrs.scnat.ch/en">Swiss Commission on
	Remote Sensing</a>. It is a platform to allow exchange among
	young and established researchers, active in the understanding
	of our environment and society through images acquired by a
	variety of sensors, from satellites in space all the way to
	drones and cameras in mobile phones.
        <br><br>
        During this three day event, young researchers (typically PhD candidates) will interact
        with senior researchers and present their latest results, as well as participate in community
        building activities, which will prepare them for active life in the area of remote sensing.

        <b>Abstract submissions</b>: the official abstract submission period has ended, but we are still accepting late submissions (see <a href="#abstract_submission">here</a> for details)
        <br><br>
        <b>Registration:</b>
        Registration is now open (see <a href="#registration">here</a> for details). Registration is kept to a nominally small, non-refundable fee (50 CHF for students and postdocs, 100 CHF for senior researchers). <b>Regular registration will close 15 August.</b>
        <br><br>
        <b>Accommodation and travel:</b> Attendees have to cover their own travel and hotel expenses. A list of hotels and other accommodations will be posted here. Students and postdocs are eligible to receive a to-be-determined compensation for their accommodation.

      <!-- Program  section -->
      <h2 id="program">Program</h2>
      <div>
        A detailed program will be released here upon availability. The program will contain poster sessions, lightning and PhD highlight talks, keynotes and a panel discussion event.
        Furthermore, we expect to organize a social event (most likely a hike accompanied by dinner) and an evening reception on Monday, which will be covered by the registration fee, as will be daily lunches.
      </div>


      <!-- abstract section -->
      <h2 id="abstract_submission">Abstract Submission - Late submissions still possible!</h2>
      <div>
        SRSD is an event for the Swiss community to share their science and results, but without the extra
        peer review burden of a traditional conference.
        <br><br>
        Therefore, we <b>solicit abstract contributions corresponding to papers presented in 2022/23 at major remote sensing conferences or published in top tier remote sensing journals</b>. Examples are IGARSS2022/23, the ISPRS congress, AGU/EGU, Remote Sensing of Environment, IEEE TGRS, etc.
        <br><br>
        At submission stage, it will be requested to upload a short abstract (1 paragraph), and to provide full bibliographic information, as well as a link to an open access version of the paper. If the paper is behind a paywall or still under review, please upload a preprint on arxiv.org or to a file transfer platform (e.g., Google drive) and provide the corresponding link at submission.
	<br><br>Please use this <strong><a href="https://forms.gle/KwDcSei4kfS9caw16">link</a></strong> to submit your abstract. Your information will be treated confidentially.
      </div>

      <!-- registration section -->
      <h2 id="registration">Registration</h2>
      <div>
        You may now register for the meeting on our registration website: <a href="https://srsd2023.wpcomstaging.com/">https://srsd2023.wpcomstaging.com/</a>. Please pick your appropriate rate, fill in the requested information and pay for your registration; note that you can only pay with a VISA/Mastercard and that registration fees are non-refundable. You will receive an invoice for your payment, but this may take a bit (we have to trigger this process manually and summer holiday season is coming up quickly).
      </div>

      <!-- Photo contest section --> 
      <h2><s>Reseach Photo Contest</s></h2>
      <div>
        <s>As part of SRSD 2023, we will host a photo contest. Every participant is eligible to submit one research-related picture to this contest. The picture may either show active research activities or results from research activities; be creative!
        All participants of the SRSD 2023 will be eligible to cast a vote among all contest submissions and the winner will receive a prize!</s>
        <p>Unfortunately, we have to cancel the photo contest as the number of submissions was too small...</p>
