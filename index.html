        The Swiss Remote Sensing Days (SRSD) is a gathering for the Swiss remote sensing community
        including young and established researchers, active in the understanding of our environment
        and society through images acquired by a variety of sensors, from satellites in space all
        the way to drones and cameras in mobile phones.
        <br><br>
        During this three day event, young researchers (typically PhD candidates) will interact
        with senior researchers and present their latest results, as well as participate in community
        building activities, which will prepare them for active life in the area of remote sensing.

      <!-- Program  section -->
      <h2 id="program">Program</h2>
      <div>
        A detailed program will be released here upon availability. The program will contain poster sessions, lightning and PhD highlight talks, keynotes and a panel discussion event.
        Furthermore, we expect to organize a social event (most likely a hike accompanied by a dinner), an evening reception and a research photo contest. Lunches will be covered by
        the registration fee.
      </div>


      <!-- abstract section -->
      <h2 id="abstract_submission">Abstract Submission - starting 31 May 2023</h2>
      <div>
        SRSD is an event for the Swiss community to share their science and results, but without the extra
        peer review burden of a traditional conference.
        <br><br>
        Therefore, we <b>solicit abstract contributions corresponding to papers presented in 2022/23 at major remote sensing conferences or published in top tier remote sensing journals</b>. Examples are IGARSS2022/23, the ISPRS congress, AGU/EGU, Remote Sensing of Environment, IEEE TGRS, etc.
        <br><br>
        At submission stage, it will be requested to upload a short abstract (1 paragraph), and to provide full bibliographic information, as well as a link to an open access version of the paper. If the paper is behind a paywall or still under review, please upload a preprint on arxiv.org or a file transfer platform (e.g., Google drive) and provide the corresponding link at submission.
      </div>

      <!-- Photo contest section --> 
      <h2>Reseach Photo Contest</h2>
      <div>
        As part of SRSD 2023, we will host a photo contest. Every participant is eligible to submit one research-related picture to this contest. The picture may either show active research activities or results from research activities; be creative!
        All participants of the SRSD 2023 will be eligible to cast a vote among all contest submissions and the winner will receive a price.
